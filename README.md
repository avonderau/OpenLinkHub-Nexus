# OpenLinkHub Nexus — Enhanced Linux Hardware Control

> **Independently maintained fork** of [OpenLinkHub by Nikola Jurkovic](https://github.com/jurkovic-nikola/OpenLinkHub). This repository adds experimental Corsair iCUE NEXUS customization while preserving the original project's broader Linux hardware-control capabilities.

[![Nexus Go tests](https://github.com/avonderau/OpenLinkHub-Nexus/actions/workflows/nexus-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avonderau/OpenLinkHub-Nexus/actions/workflows/nexus-tests.yml)

## What is different in this fork?

- **Corsair iCUE NEXUS:** editable 640 × 48 custom screens with metrics, text, bars, graphs, clocks, images, buttons, per-widget colors and gradients, and touch/swipe navigation. Uploaded background images can be static or animated GIFs.
- **Mirabox and Elgato Stream Deck LCD keys (Elgato: experimental, not hardware-tested):** editable key pages, custom PNG/JPEG artwork, keyboard shortcuts, saved macros and media actions. Per-key live metrics support **Value only, Line graph, Bar graph, Fuel gauge, and Ring gauge**, including a per-key visualization color picker. Existing graph layouts are preserved.
- **Live telemetry:** CPU/GPU temperatures and utilization, fan/pump readings, memory, network and disk throughput (subject to host sensor availability).
- **Automated checks:** Go and Deck tests, Nexus editor UI tests, security checks and upstream compatibility tests.

- **Shared icon-pack library:** import, rename and delete reusable PNG, JPEG and SVG icon packs (up to 4,096 icons per pack, 32 MiB ZIP upload) and Stream Deck `.streamDeckIconPack` archives in **Settings → Icon Packs**; select their icons in either device editor. SVG import needs the optional Linux `rsvg-convert` utility (`librsvg2-bin`) and converts the artwork to PNG.

For setup and feature details, see the [Nexus development notes](docs/nexus-fork.md), [Deck plugins (experimental)](docs/deck-plugins.md), [Deck metric guide](docs/deck-live-metrics.md), and [Deck action guide](docs/deck-actions.md).

## Screenshots

**Development status:** The features described here refer to the repository's development code; published release assets may lag behind `main`. Nexus and Deck customization remains under active development, and physical-device actions and desktop integration should be tested on real hardware. For **Open URL** and **Launch Application** buttons when OpenLinkHub runs as a background service, see the [local Nexus desktop agent setup](docs/nexus-desktop-launch.md). These buttons open on the computer hosting OpenLinkHub, not on a separate WebUI client. Do not assume all upstream installation packages include these features.

See [Nexus development notes](docs/nexus-fork.md) for details and limitations.

## Installation of this fork

To build **this fork** from source, follow the manual dependency instructions below, then use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avonderau/OpenLinkHub-Nexus.git
cd OpenLinkHub-Nexus
CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW='-fno-strict-overflow' go build -o OpenLinkHub .
```

For the official fork build, use the **[OpenLinkHub Nexus releases](https://github.com/avonderau/OpenLinkHub-Nexus/releases)**. The latest fork release is **`0.9.5N`** (built on the fork's earlier `0.9.4N` release; `N` distinguishes this independently maintained version from upstream OpenLinkHub).

**Native packages (Linux amd64):** Release `0.9.5N` provides a `.deb` for modern Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint and an `.rpm` for Fedora-compatible distributions, along with the portable tarball. On a conventional systemd installation, download the appropriate package and matching `.sha256` file from [release 0.9.5N](https://github.com/avonderau/OpenLinkHub-Nexus/releases/tag/0.9.5N) and verify its checksum before installing:

```bash
# Debian, Ubuntu or Mint:
sha256sum -c OpenLinkHub-Nexus_0.9.5N_amd64.deb.sha256
sudo apt install ./OpenLinkHub-Nexus_0.9.5N_amd64.deb

# Fedora, RHEL or compatible:
sha256sum -c OpenLinkHub-Nexus-0.9.5N-1.x86_64.rpm.sha256
sudo dnf install ./OpenLinkHub-Nexus-0.9.5N-1.x86_64.rpm
```

**Compatibility:** These packages wrap the existing Linux amd64 release executable, which requires **glibc 2.38 or newer**. This excludes, for example, Debian 12 and RHEL 9. Use a distro with a compatible libc and device libraries. RPM's auto-generated ELF dependencies and DEB's libc dependency enforce this requirement. 

**Before migrating from another installation:** Back up `config.json`, device profiles, macros and saved Nexus layouts. The native packages install the `OpenLinkHub.service` system service and may conflict with existing manual, upstream or user-service installations. See the [0.9.5N release notes](docs/releases/0.9.5N.md) for details. For immutable distributions, use the portable bundle instead of DEB/RPM.

The fork's [remote installer](https://github.com/avonderau/OpenLinkHub-Nexus/blob/main/remote-install.sh) downloads release assets **from this repository**, not upstream. Review the script before running it. Existing upstream package managers and releases do **not** contain these Nexus changes.

See the [0.9.4N security review](docs/security-review-0.9.4N.md) and [desktop launcher guide](docs/nexus-desktop-launch.md) for installation and security boundaries.

Do not use the upstream installer, PPA, Copr, or upstream releases if you intend to install this fork's experimental features. The legacy installation sections below document **upstream distribution channels**, not builds of this fork.

### Upstream installation (recommended)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jurkovic-nikola/OpenLinkHub/main/remote-install.sh | bash
```
This script will:
- Create a system group named openlinkhub
- Add your current user to openlinkhub 
- Install OpenLinkHub in your home directory. 
- Create a user systemd service 
- Copy 99-openlinkhub.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/ 
- Start the service after installation. 
- You can use this script for installation or upgrade purposes.
- Before running this script, uninstall any previously installed versions of OpenLinkHub

### Upstream installation (automatic)
1. Download either .deb or .rpm package from the latest Release, depending on your Linux distribution
2. Open a terminal
3. Navigate to the folder where the package is downloaded
```bash
# Debian-Based (deb)

xdg-open http://127.0.0.1:27003
```

### 6. Configuration
`/opt/OpenLinkHub/config.json`
```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "listenPort": 27003,
  "listenAddress": "127.0.0.1",
  "cpuSensorChip": "k10temp",
  "manual": false,
  "frontend": true,
  "metrics": true,
  "resumeDelay": 15000,
  "memory": false,
  "memorySmBus": "i2c-0",
  "memoryType": 4,
  "exclude": [],
  "decodeMemorySku": true,
  "memorySku": "",
  "logFile": "",
  "logLevel": "info",
  "enhancementKits": [],
  "temperatureOffset": 0,
  "amdGpuIndex": 0,
  "amdsmiPath": "",
  "cpuTempFile": "",
  "graphProfiles": false,
  "ramTempViaHwmon": false,
  "nvidiaGpuIndex": [0],
  "defaultNvidiaGPU": 0,
  "enableGamepad": true,
  "enableMotherboard": false,
  "motherboardBiosOnExit": false,
  "appMonitor": false
}
```
- listenPort: HTTP server port.
- listenAddress: Address for HTTP server to listen on.
- cpuSensorChip: CPU sensor chip for temperature. `k10temp` or `zenpower` for AMD and `coretemp` for Intel
- manual: set to true if you want to use your own UI for device control. Setting this to true will disable temperature monitoring and automatic device speed adjustments.
- frontend: set to false if you do not need the WebUI console, and you are making your own UI app.
- metrics: enable or disable Prometheus metrics
- resumeDelay: amount of time in milliseconds for the program to reinitialize all devices after sleep / resume
- memory: Enable overview / control over the memory
- memorySmBus: i2c smbus sensor id
- memoryType: 4 for DDR4, 5 for DDR5
- exclude: list of device IDs in uint16 format to exclude from program control
- decodeMemorySku: set to false to manually define `memorySku` value.
- memorySku: Memory part number, e.g. (CMT64GX5M2B5600Z40)
- You can find the memory part number by running the following command: `sudo dmidecode -t memory | grep 'Part Number'`
- logFile: custom location for logging. Default is empty.
  - Defining `-` for logFile will send all logs to standard console output.
  - If you change the location of logging, make sure the application username has permission to write to that folder.
- logLevel: log level to log in console or file.
- enhancementKits: DDR4/DDR5 Light Enhancement Kits addresses.
- If your kit is installed in the first and third slot, the value would be: `"enhancementKits": [80,82],`. This value is a byte value converted from hexadecimal output in `i2cdetect`
  - When kits are used, you need to set `decodeMemorySku` to `false` and define `memorySku`
- temperatureOffset: Temperature offset for AMD Threadripper CPUs
- amdGpuIndex: GPU device index. You can find your GPU index via `amd-smi static --asic --json`
- amdsmiPath: Manual path to amd-smi binary (not recommended). A better way is to define `amd-smi` path in `$PATH` variable if missing.
- cpuTempFile: custom hwmon temperature input file, e.g. tempX_input. Use in combination with `cpuSensorChip`.
- graphProfiles: Setting this value to `true` will enable graph-based temperature profiles on `/temperature` endpoint and enable temperature interpolation.
- ramTempViaHwmon: Switch to true if you want to monitor RAM temperature via the hwmon system. With this option, you don't have to unload modules to get the temperature. (Require 6.11+ kernel)
- nvidiaGpuIndex: NVIDIA multi-gpu setup.
- defaultNvidiaGPU: default index of NVIDIA GPU, default is 0.
  - If you use vfio-pci/pass-through, you have to set it to -1 to avoid conflicts with NVIDIA modules.
- enableGamepad: Enable or disable Virtual Gamepad used for SCUF controllers.
- enableMotherboard: Enable control of motherboard PWM headers.
- motherboardBiosOnExit: Switch PWM headers to BIOS mode when program exits.
- appMonitor: Enable or disable Application Integration.

### 7. Progressive Web App (PWA) UI
The web UI supports installation as a progressive web app (PWA). With a supported browser, this allows the UI to appear as a standalone application.
Chromium-based browsers support PWAs; Firefox currently does not.
GNOME 'Web,' also known as 'Epiphany', is a good option for PWAs on GNOME systems.
